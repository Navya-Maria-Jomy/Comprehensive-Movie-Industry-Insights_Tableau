## Introduction

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the movie industry using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. 
Through the power of Tableau, we've created interactive visualizations that offer deep insights into various aspects of the film industry, including financial performance, temporal trends, production company analysis, and audience reception.

## Dataset Description

**Dataset Name:** TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset
**Source:** Kaggle, originally from The Movie Database (TMDb)

This dataset contains detailed information about 4,803 movies, including:
- Financial data (budget, revenue)
- Production details (companies, countries)
- Movie characteristics (genres, languages, runtime)
- Audience metrics (popularity, vote average, vote count)

## Objectives

1. **Financial Performance Analysis:** Explore the relationship between movie budgets and revenues, analyzing profitability trends across different decades.
2. **Temporal Analysis:** Analyze the evolution of the movie industry from 1916 to 2016, focusing on genre-specific performance and industry growth.
3. **Production Company Performance:** Evaluate the performance of production companies in terms of revenue, profitability, and popularity from the 1990s to the 2010s.
4. **Audience Reception:** Assess how different genres and production companies influence audience engagement and popularity over the decades.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Normalized and parsed JSON fields (genres, keywords, production companies)
   - Cleaned missing values and ensured data consistency
   - Filtered and aggregated data for specific analyses

2. **Tableau Visualization:** 
   - Created interactive dashboards for each major analysis area
   - Utilized various chart types (treemaps, bubble charts, line charts, etc.) to represent different aspects of the data
   - Implemented filters for dynamic data exploration

## Key Findings

- The movie industry has shown significant growth in revenue and budget from 1916 to 2016.
- PG-13 and PG rated movies dominate in terms of quantity and revenue.
